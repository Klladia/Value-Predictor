# Car Value Predictor

### The Car Value Predictor is a dash app written in Python that calculates the value of a car based on data scrapped from a car selling website. 

### Information about a specific model entered on the dashboard is transmitted to Otomoto, a popular car selling site in Poland, to search for similar cars.
### The data extracted from the ads is then used to build a machine learning model to predict the value of a car based on characteristics such as make, model, year of manufacture, mileage, engine capacity, horsepower, transmission type and fuel type.
